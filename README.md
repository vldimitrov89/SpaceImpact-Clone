# SpaceImpact-Clone
a clone of Space Impact - an old game for Nokia phones

Developing a small game with Kaboom.js - https://kaboomjs.com

Due to browser policies you'll need a static file server to load local files.
I use live-server plugin for VS Code but you can use:
    - (with python) $ python3 -m http.server $PORT
    - (with caddy) $ caddy file-server --browse --listen $PORT
